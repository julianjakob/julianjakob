<h1 class="headline">THEORETICAL OVERVIEW</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">Humans inherently feel, experience, and inscribe their narratives on the metaphorical "tabula." Derived from the Latin term "tabula rasa," meaning a blank board, this concept was embraced by British empiricists in the 17th to 18th centuries. According to their belief, every individual is born with a pristine slate that gradually becomes filled throughout one's life. In contrast, realists held the view that existence is contingent upon perception. In this project, I delve into the empiricist perspective, where each card serves as a conduit for experiencing various emotions or interactions. Whether eliciting feelings or facilitating unique interactions, these cards metaphorically contribute to the ongoing narrative on the individual's "tabula," offering a tangible exploration of the empiricist philosophy.</p>

<h1 class="headline">VISUAL IDENTITY</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">distinguished by its unique visual aesthetics, the card game incorporates typographic elements that eloquently capture the essence of inscribing messages on a board, reminiscent of the concept of "tabula." noteworthy is the deliberate design choice of presenting headlines in all capital letters, creating a deliberate and striking contrast with the lowercase letters used throughout the rest of the text. this intentional typographic hierarchy enhances the overall visual appeal, providing players with a visually engaging and cohesive experience.</p>

<h1 class="headline">PACKAGING</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">the packaging comprises both the packaging itself and an accompanying folder that provides information about the game. the folder and packaging are interconnected, as the counters on the folder seamlessly align with the letters cut out on the front of the packaging. this design facilitates a cohesive connection between the items, aiding the user in understanding how to open and interact with them in a clear and intuitive manner.</p>
