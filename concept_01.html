<h1 class="headline">THEORETICAL OVERVIEW</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">my project deals with the damast knives from bernhard lassacher, a small business in pinzgau, austria. bernhard lassacher is firmly convinced that his products stand out on the market due to their individuality, durability, and sustainability. each of his knives is a custom-made piece and is exclusively made from hand-forged pinzgau damast steel. the art of creating a variety of objects from a cold and immobile material using fire, heat, and physical strength fascinates him time and time again.</p>

<h1 class="headline">VISUAL IDENTITY</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">the visual identity was inspired by the book "the design manual for contemporary design" by martin lorenz as well as the works of albrecht d√ºrer. during my form experiments, it turned out that the rhombus symbol is best suited as the basic shape, especially for 
  the logo, which will be used as a wordmark. the visual identity not only represents the damast knives but also bernhard lassacher's personality, creating a personalized identity.</p>

<h1 class="headline">PACKAGING</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">my packaging design is based on the five fundamental psychological principles of interaction by don norman. special attention has been paid to ensuring that the packaging process generates tension, contains clear signals, the mapping of various functionalities is clear, and the relationships between the product features and the usability are clearly depicted. an essential element of the packaging design is also safety.
  the cardboard itself is intended to be sturdy and resistant. the interior of the cardboard box is filled with soft padding material since each knife has different dimensions. additionally, each knife is delivered with a leather sheath for protection.</p>
